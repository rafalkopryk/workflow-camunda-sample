        * `followUpDate` - reset by providing an empty String

        Providing any of those attributes with a `null` value or omitting it preserves
        the persisted attribute's value.

        The assignee cannot be adjusted with this endpoint, use the Assign task endpoint.
        This ensures correct event emission for assignee changes.

            Future extensions might include:

              - ability to set local variables for different flow scopes

            For now, however, the start instruction is implicitly a "startBeforeElement" instruction
